Dynamic Programming:

**Memoization recipe:**
Steps:
1. Make it work
	a. Visualize as a tree
	b. Implement tree using recursion
	c. Test
2. Make it efficient
	a. Add a memo object
	b. Add a new base case to return value from memo object
	c. Store returned values in memo object


Overall Time Complexity would depend on:
 	Height of the tree
 	Branching factor
